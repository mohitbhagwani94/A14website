							<h3>Round 1</h3>
							The participant will go through the given maze which has many obstacles like Oil, Water, Sand Lumps, and Dead 
Ends to find the 1st Dragon Ball and make his way out of the Maze with it. <br>
The Maze is not covered and can be seen by the Coordinators during the whole event, making their task only 
navigating through it. 

							

							<h3>Round 2</h3>
							The round consists of an arena full of like pulley, switch gate, rotating disk etc. The bot has to 
complete the arena and should get two balls that are placed there in arena. <br>
They have to get the balls and should come back one by one. The bot which will succeed in getting two balls 
will be considered for third round.


							<h3>Round 3</h3>
							This round is a 1 on 1 duel against competitors trying to gather the Dragon Balls through a game of soccer. <br>
Three rounds are played and the 1st Robot that scores 2 Goals, i.e gets 2 Dragon Balls across will be the 
next to qualify.
		
							<h3>Round 4</h3>
							This Round is a Covered Maze where the Robot operator cannot get a Birdâ€™s Eye View of the Maze.<br>
A wireless camera is provided to the operator which is fixed on the Robot which is used to steer the Robot.<br>
The Maze has various obstacles to hinder his movement as well as Dead Ends and Mechanisms to slow him 
down.<br>
Completing the Maze gives him the 6th Dragon Ball.

							<h3>Round 5</h3>
							The last round is a partially maze with a race to gather the last Dragon Ball and bring it 
across the other side. Half of the Maze is open and the other half is covered with areas that have mirrors inside to confuse the Robot. 
When 4 teams compete one on one, the winners of the two matches compete with one another to decide the final
winner and hence revive Goku by gathering all the 7 Dragon Balls.
